## portfolio

I had two goals while developing my portfolio. I wanted to take advantage of Bootstrap, and learn how I could use Sass to make my CSS cleaner and more powerful. This was my first project using the two frameworks, and I learned a ton about CSS and how to make responsive websites. I decided to make it a one page website to simplify the information and deliver the content as concisely as possible.

### Code

-The nav bar of this page was coded using Bootstap
-All of the scrolling animations were developed using jQuery
-The CSS was done in Sass
-I used JavaScript for form validation and other areas such as the JavaScript hover effect
-The form is submitted to my email via Google Forms
